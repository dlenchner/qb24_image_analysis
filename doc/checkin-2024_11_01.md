# Check-in Number 1 - November 01, 2024 #


## Addressing prior feedback ##

In the scripts we write, we are providing very detailed and informative comments to guide others through our thought process

We are keeping track of our proposed steps and breaking the project up into manageable chunks


## Project progress ##

We have written a python script (test.py) that performs the following functions:
    - Opens an image file from a command line argument
    - Extracts metadata from the file (image size, format, and color mode)
    - Generates a report of that metadata and writes it to a .txt file
    - Generates an array of color values for the original image
    - Converts the image to grayscale
    - Generates an array of pixel intensities from the grayscale image
    - Writes the pixel intensity values for each pixel to the report file

We are beginning to work on revising the script in such a way that allows us to isolate a region of interest and report average fluorescence in that region.


Looking at our proposed steps, we have finished step 1 (barring any improvements in efficiency) and are currently working on step 2:

1. ~ Read an individual image file into Python, quantify fluorescence intensity at each pixel, and report that fluorescence intensity. ~
2. Build on the work in step 1 by developing code that can isolate a region of interest, subtract background intensity, and report the average fluorescence intensity just in that region.
3. Modify the code to analyze two or more images at a time.
4. Read the fluorescence intensity data from each image into R.
5. Generate a plot in R that displays the fluorescence intensity data from each of the images.


## Project organization ##

Directories and their descriptions:

    - /data/ contains two sample fluorescent images that we have been using to test our initial code and will eventually hold the fluorescent images we plan to run for analysis
    - /src/ contains our test code files and will eventually hold our final code files
    - /doc/ contains this document and will eventually hold any supporting documentation for the project

# Struggles and obstacles ##

Software
    We are not sure how to identify and report the software (including the specific versions and packages) that we are using for the project

Code
    The method we are using to analyze the test fluorescent images is certainly not the most efficient, though it seems to work well enough
    Establishing a quality control method for the image metadata is trickier than we expected
        For instance, ensuring that the image files are the correct format (jpg, png, etc.) and correct size for analysis (this will be more important as we try to expand our program to analyze multiple images at once, as maintain consistent formatting across each image will be important to generating reliable analyses)

Math and data analysis
    We are struggling to figure out the best way to report fluorescent intensity


Datsets
    In a perfect world, we would like to eventually apply our code to a small set of publicly available fluorescent image files (assuming we can get through the steps laid out in the README.md file to show our code is working properly). We are still struggling to find a good set of images to use. We plan to keep looking through the [Image Data Resource](http://idr.openmicroscopy.org).
        
    
Questions
    For reporting pixel intensities, is there a way to use the print() or write() functions to add the arrays as an arrays to the generated report file, rather than having to convert them to strings first?
