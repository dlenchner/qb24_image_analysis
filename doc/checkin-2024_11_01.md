# Check-in Number 1 - November 01, 2024 #


## Addressing prior feedback ##

In the scripts we write, we are providing very detailed and informative comments to guide others through our thought process

We are keeping track of our proposed steps and breaking the project up into manageable chunks


## Project progress ##

We have written a python script (test.py) that performs the following functions:
- Opens an image file from a command line argument
- Extracts metadata from the file (image size, format, and color mode)
- Generates a report of that metadata and writes it to a .txt file    
- Generates an array of color values for the original image
- Converts the image to grayscale
- Generates an array of pixel intensities from the grayscale image
- Writes the pixel intensity values for each pixel to the report file

We also wrote an improved python script (test2.py) that streamlines the analysis and performs the following functions:
- Generates a tsv report file for the image analysis
- Opens an image file form the command line
- Generates an array of color values for the original image
- Performs a quality assurance check to ensure that the image was read in properly
- Converts the image to grayscale and generates an array of pixel intensities
- Establishes a threshold intensity
- Identifies pixels with greater intensity than the threshold
- Reports the total intensity from the regions of interest, the number of pixels in the regions of interest, and the average intensity in the regions of interest


Looking at our proposed steps, we have addressed steps 1 and 2 (barring any improvements in efficiency):

1. ~~Read an individual image file into Python, quantify fluorescence intensity at each pixel, and report that fluorescence intensity.~~
2. ~~Build on the work in step 1 by developing code that can isolate a region of interest, subtract background intensity, and report the average fluorescence intensity just in that region.~~
3. Modify the code to analyze two or more images at a time.
4. Read the fluorescence intensity data from each image into R.
5. Generate a plot in R that displays the fluorescence intensity data from each of the images.


## Project organization ##

Directories and their descriptions:
- /data/ contains some sample fluorescent images that we have been using to test our initial code and will eventually hold the fluorescent images we plan to run for analysis
- /src/ contains our test code files and will eventually hold our final code files
- /doc/ contains this document and will eventually hold any supporting documentation for the project


# Struggles and obstacles ##

Software
- We are not sure how to identify and report the software (including the specific versions and packages) that we are using for the project

Code
- The method we are using to analyze the test fluorescent images is certainly not the most efficient, though it seems to work well enough
- Establishing a quality control method for the image metadata is trickier than we expected
    - For instance, ensuring that the image files are the correct format (jpg, png, etc.) and correct size for analysis (this will be more important as we try to expand our program to analyze multiple images at once, as maintain consistent formatting across each image will be important to generating reliable analyses)

Math and data analysis
- We are struggling to figure out the best way to calculate and report fluorescent intensity

Datsets
- In a perfect world, we would like to eventually apply our code to a small set of publicly available fluorescent image files (assuming we can get through the steps laid out in the README.md file to show our code is working properly). We are still struggling to find a good set of images to use. We plan to keep looking through the [Image Data Resource](http://idr.openmicroscopy.org).


## Questions ##
- Is there a neat way to display the pixel intensities in a report file?
- How can we mathematically determine fluorescent intensity and report it in a format that is usable downstream?
